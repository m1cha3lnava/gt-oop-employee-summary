## Description

A command line app that creates an html page displaying the roster for a set of employees that you add. It first prompts the user to input the manager's info, validates the input, and then gives more prompts to help you build a team of either engineers or interns. Once you are done entering the employee info, select I am finished and it will then generate your html page.
